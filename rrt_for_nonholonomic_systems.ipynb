    "This tutorial will walk you through how to create an integrated OMPL and PyBullet program modeling constrianed systems.  OMPL will be used for planning and PyBullet will be used to render and create the simulation.

    "# Motivation\n",
    "The motivation for this project is versatility of snake robots and the beneficial aspects that they come with when used in certain situations.  Snake robots work well in space, cluttered ground, and narrow environments.  They work well in space because they have a small size and can easily float down the side of a hallway instead of taking up a large amount of space otherwise.  They also work well in clusttered and rugged terrain because they are more flexible and less prone to getting stuck or tipping over like some other robots.  Due to snake robots' small size, they are also much more capable of fitting into areas that are smaller.  They can navigate down tubes or in cracks in certain areas."

    "# Related Work\n",
    "Even though I chose to use Rapidly Expanding Random Trees, there is no short of different algorithms that can be used to plan for different environments.  Besides RRT and its many variants such as RRT*, there also exists Probabilistic Road Map (PRM), Voronoi Diagrams, A*, D*, and even evolutionary algorithms.  Testing out how each of these performs in different situations is a good approach to a research topic.  The paper, Survey of Robot 3D Path Planning Algorithms, the authors analysis a large number of different approaches to robot path planning and find where some work and others do not.  This paper is not only useful to compare different planning algorithms, but also to learn about new algorithms that you may not have heard about yet.\n",

    "The Rapidly Expanding Random Tree algorithm was developed in 1998 and has grown in large popularity since then, especially in the robotics field.  This is the algorithm that I chose to utilize in my project.  The original paper for it describes the inner workings of it and propositions as to how it can be used.  They discuss some of the beneficial properties of using this algorithm such as it being biased towards exploring previously unexplored regions and that it is probabilistically complete.  This means that as time approaches infinity and the number of branches increases, the gurantee that a solution will be found if one exists increases.\n",

    "In Yang et. al, the researchers are planning for a snake robot in an unknown environment, but they do not have an all knowing view as in my experiment.  Their approach is similar to how I implemented mine in that they are generating waypoints that the robot is following.  We both chose to conduct this in a similar way, by using the angle heading of the robot to aim towards the goal.  They are also planning in a maze like environment.  The researchers also used RRT and a variant ERRT to test out planning.\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "There are two main technologies that were used in this project, these being the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) and PyBullet.  I used OMPL to model, constrain, and plan the path for the snake robot from start to goal.  OMPL used Rapidly Expanding Random Trees (RRT) to search the state space for valid states.  A provided data file would be read in with data about where the obstacles were to avoid as well as other configuration constants.  Once the solution path had been found, the path was sampled to create a set of waypoints that would then be passed to the simulation and snake robot.\n",
    "The snake robot was simulated using PyBullet, a physics library ported to Python.  PyBullet has a lot of support for function that deal with collision and simulation in three dimensions.  PyBullet then generated a visual representation of the snake and the maze environment.  Additionally, the waypoints generated from OMPL were read in and displayed as well as visual, but collisionless, nodes.  A controller was also defined that would guide the snake between waypoints and this was used in the running simulation.  Finally, the simulation was displayed and run and you can watch as the snake travels towards its goal.  Once reaching its goal, it would stop, as it had succeeded."

It will create the constrained space of the snake robot.  It will use RRT to plan and find a path from the start location to the goal location while respecting the boundaries of the obstacles and the constraints on motion from the dynamics of the snake robot.  Once it has run and found a path, it will extract out the waypoints and deposit them to data files like waypoints.data, waypoints_10.data, and waypoints_50.data.  The difference between these files is the first has all waypoints (approx 1400), the second has every tenth point (approx 140), and the final has every 50th point (approx 28).  The full path will visualized int he 2D chart created using matplotlib.\n",

PyBullet will construct the walls, the snake, and the waypoints as static collision objects, dynamic collision objects, and collisionless visual objects respectively.  Then it will run the simulation and show that the generated path works in the simulated environment."

    "As you can see, the planning algorithm was successful in finding a proper path to get from the start to the end goal in a moderately efficient manner.  The idea for this is not to necessarily be the optimal path, but it should be a somewhat reasonable path.  The constraints on the motion provide a proper path for the snake robot.  Although the snake can turn somewhat sharply, it cannot necessarily turn immediately when it wants to.  It moves by following an S-curve path on the ground.  So as it is curving towards the left, but it wants to turn to the right, it won't be able to accomplish this immediately.\n",
    "Originally, I wanted to implement this problem using RRT* as it is usually faster than RRT in terms of both search time and path distance.  However, when I started to add in the constraints on motion and modeling using them, I quickly realized that RRT* would no longer be possible due to RRT*'s update of shorter path.  Because of this, I decided to stick with RRT.\n",
    "The generated path works well, it obeys all the obstacle and margin avoidance it is supposed to and is still able to create a possible path from the start to the finish.  The simulation works well and proves that the generated path and implemented controller work.  If it didn't work, then the snake would not follow the path or would get stuck somewhere.\n",

    "No matter what project it is, there are always opportunities for future work or exploration in a similar area.  For this project, some future extensions could be to test in different and more complex environments, and the ability to handle dynamic environments.\n",
    "More complex environments could be extending this project to a fully 3D planning environment which would have different verticalities and different terrain.  The different terrain could be things like rocks and rubble that the robot has to decide if it wants to move along by traversing them or going around it.\n",
    "A dynamic environment is one in which there are objects in it that are not static.  In all of my testing, I used static obstacles that did not move over time.  In a dynamic environment, obstacles that were in one place at one time may be in a completely different place later on.  This adds difficulty because the robot must be constantly updating its representation of the world as well as predicting where the dynamic object might be in the future to make sure that it isn't going to collide with it during its motionn."
